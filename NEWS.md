2.3.0 2021-10-15
================

Revise to use xdis 6.0.0 - Python version comparisions use tuples instead of floats
which are horribly broken on 3.10.

Some other minor changes as well.

2.2.1 2020-08-30
================

Add the ability to remap filenames by file pattern. Here is a scenario:
I am doing remote debugging so that the files seen by the debugger issuing commands is
in a different location than where the core parts of the debugger get run.

While it may be the case that most of the time you expect that
_debugger_, not the this module, need to handle the remap, library routines
here like `add_remap_pat()` and `remap_file_pat()` can be useful.


2.2.0 2020-06-27
================

Uses revised `xdis`. Export `cache_code_lines()` which is needed in upcoming `trepan3k`
Added  `cache_offset_info()`.

2.1.0 2020-06-12 Fleetwood 66
==============================

This shifts responsibility of getting line offset info to `xdis`. But we have routines here
since we manage file objects and cache them.

To this end routines `code_lines()` and and `code_line_info()` were added.

Line information now contains all offsets for a given line number in
the module or function that the offset is relative to. There are various options
for indicting whether you want the offset informaiton or just the line numbers,
nnd if you want to note which line numbers are dups.

2.0.1 2018-04-22
================

2.0.0's setup.py was missing the package parameter and this botched the whole release.

2.0.0 2018-04-22
================

* We remove dependency on coverage which was writing .coverage files. Fixes #25
  A dependency on xdis was added, but that's okay since that allows handling
  cross-version bytecode which is a good thing
* `py2pyc()` renamed to `resolve_name_to_path()`, and use `importlib` to help
  use resolve names if that is available. This is why we need to bump from 1.0 to 2.0
* blacken some buffers and regularize imports

1.0.1 2018-04-16
=================

- Pygments needs to be 1.4 on Python 2.4 branch.

1.0.0 2018-01-26
================

With this release, we use semantic versioning. There is
some API incompatiablity with the last release, and old
compatibility routines have been removed

- Redo the way file to file line remapping works. The API changes here
- unamp_file_line has a reverse option to indicate which way to map/unmap
- remove older compatibility routine cache()
